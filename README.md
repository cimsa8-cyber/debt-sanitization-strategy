# Debt Sanitization Strategy

This project explores modular strategies for debt reduction, credit cycle optimization, and financial clarity. It integrates technical simulations, stewardship and peace of mind.

## Goals

- Simulate debt repayment scenarios across multiple credit instruments.
- Optimize payment timing to reduce interest and maximize liquidity.
- Document strategies that align with disciplined financial stewardship.
- Provide YAML-based configuration for reproducible simulations.

## Structure

- `data/`: Sample datasets for debt cycles and payment history.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for simulation and optimization.
- `.claude/`: Claude-specific context files (optional).

## Spiritual Foundation

Inspired by Philippians 4:6 — “Do not be anxious about anything…” — this project seeks to bring peace and clarity to financial decision-making through structured, intentional planning.
